# LRInterface

A Python interface that is of great use to employees because it greatly facilitates the process of leave requests.

Currently the application takes data from a JSON file, but in the future the data will be taken from a graphical interface. 
Then, with the help of these data, the body of the leaving request is built. And the text is sent in an email to the employee's supervisor.

!!! To be able to run this project, you will need to modify the Input.json folder with correct data. Then run SendEmail.py.

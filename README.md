# LRInterface

A Python interface that is of great use to employees because it greatly facilitates the process of leave requests.

Currently the application takes data from a JSON file. Then with these data, the body of the leaving request is built. And the text is sent in an email to the employee's supervisor.

- To be able to run this project, you will need to modify the Input.json folder with correct data. Then run SendEmail.py.
